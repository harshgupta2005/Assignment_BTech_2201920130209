## 1. DSA Question: *3360. Stone Removal Game*

*Platform:* LeetCode

### Problem Statement
Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing stones from a pile, with Alice going first.

Alice starts by removing exactly 10 stones on her first turn.
For each subsequent turn, each player removes exactly 1 fewer stone than the previous opponent.
The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

Given a positive integer n, return true if Alice wins the game and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 12

Output: true

Explanation:

Alice removes 10 stones on her first turn, leaving 2 stones for Bob.
Bob cannot remove 9 stones, so Alice wins.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1

Output: false

Explanation:

Alice cannot remove 10 stones, so Alice loses.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 50
### Solution Code
#### C++ Implementation:
cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canAliceWin(int n) {
        int count=0;

        for(int i=10;n>=0;i--){
            if(n<i){
                break;
            }
            n-=i;
            count++;
        }
    if(count%2==0){
        return false;
    }
    return true;}
};


## 2. DSA Question: *2270. Number of Ways to Split Array*

*Platform:* LeetCode

### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.

nums contains a valid split at index i if the following are true:

The sum of the first i + 1 elements is greater than or equal to the sum of the last n - i - 1 elements.
There is at least one element to the right of i. That is, 0 <= i < n - 1.
Return the number of valid splits in nums.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Examples
#### Example 1:
*Input:*
cpp
l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]

*Output:*
cpp
[7,0,8]

*Explanation:* 342 + 465 = 807.

#### Example 2:
*Input:*
cpp
l1 = [0], l2 = [0]

*Output:*
cpp
[0]


#### Example 3:
*Input:*
cpp
l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]

*Output:*
cpp
[8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]


### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 9
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

### Solution Code
#### C++ Implementation:
cpp
```
class Solution {
public:
    int waysToSplitArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count=0;
        long long sum=0;
        long long l=0;
        long long r=0;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++){
            sum+=nums[i];
        }
        for(int j=0;j<nums.size()-1;j++){
            l+=nums[j];
            r=sum-l;
             if(l>=r){
            count++;
        }
        }
       
return count;}
};

```

## 3. DSA Question: *1508. Range Sum of Sorted Subarray Sums*

*Platform:* LeetCode

### Problem Statement
You are given the array nums consisting of n positive integers. You computed the sum of all non-empty continuous subarrays from the array and then sorted them in non-decreasing order, creating a new array of n * (n + 1) / 2 numbers.
Return the sum of the numbers from index left to index right (indexed from 1), inclusive, in the new array. Since the answer can be a huge number return it modulo 109 + 7.

### Examples
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13. 
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 3, right = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The given array is the same as example 1. We have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 3 to ri = 4 is 3 + 3 = 6.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 10
Output: 50
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
1 <= left <= right <= n * (n + 1) / 2

### Solution Code
#### C++ Implementation:
cpp
```
class Solution {
public:
    int rangeSum(vector<int>& nums, int n, int left, int right) {
        vector<int>ans;
        for(int i=0;i<nums.size();i++) {
            int sum=0;
            for(int j=i;j<nums.size();j++) {
                sum+=nums[j];
                ans.push_back(sum);
            }
        }
        sort(ans.begin(),ans.end());
                int res=0,mod=1e9+7;
        for (int i=left-1;i<=right-1;i++) {
            res=(res+ans[i])%mod;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
